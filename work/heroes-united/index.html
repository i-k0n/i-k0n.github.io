            <h3 class="project-info-titles the-problem">The Process</h3>
            <p class="project-info-body the-problem-content">After settling on some basic features such as user accounts, character select, chapter select, attack locations on the enemy, we split up to work on the different parts. One person tackled setting up the database to store the user data as well as character data that would persist as the user progressed through the chapters. One person worked on the look of the interface as well as the character select screen and chapter select screen. One person was tasked with figuring out the game logic that would run the battles. One person worked on user logins, and I worked on the character encounters. Communication was key as we constantly needed to run ideas by other team members as our tasks overlapped.</p>

        <section class="project-info-writeup">
            <h3 class="project-info-titles the-problem">The Product</h3>
            <p class="project-info-body the-problem-content">The flow of the game is like so: If you're a new user, create an account, otherwise log into your account. Choose a character, then distribute your points. You're then taken to the chapter select page where you can choose a new character if you didn't like your original choice, or choose to set out on your adventure. Each chapter on your adventure must be completed before the next one unlocks, and in each chapter you are met with an enemy to defeat. Failure to do so will end in loss and take you back to the chapter select screen to try again. Success will also take you back to the chapter select, but you will find the next chapter unlocked for you. Once the final boss has been defeated, you win the game, and are the hero of the kingdom.</p>

            <h3 class="project-info-titles the-problem">My Role</h3>
            <p class="project-info-body the-problem-content">I focused on the character encounters page, basically the actual battle for each chapter. I worked closely with my teammate that was doing the game logic, as her logic would be the bones that my assets were going to sit on top of. No one on the team was an artist, and we only had about nine days to complete the project, so we opted to use pre-made assets so we could focus on the mechanics of the game.</p>
